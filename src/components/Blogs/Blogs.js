 <p>This quote emphasizes a very important point which is that wisdom cannot be taught in schools, it can only be acquired with life experience. We, as a parent, teacher or child, tend to ignore this. This quote has another connotation that implies that continuous learning is something that is required for being successful in any field. 
Wondering how this is possible and whether learning in schools is sufficient? What else can you do to get more knowledge and experience?
First, apart from school education, giving your child necessary support and training to gain hands-on experience, developing social, communication, creative, and entrepreneurial skills are great way to help them acquire more knowledge and become future-ready.
Second, if your child is not spending enough time reading, it indicates that they might not be able to benefit from what education offers. A report in 2020 in The Guardian states that children are reading less than ever before.</p>
